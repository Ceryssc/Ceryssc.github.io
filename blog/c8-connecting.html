          <h4>Insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity</h4>
          <p>Empathy helps build trust because we interact with people with empathy, people are more likely to feel seen, heard and understood. When people feel those things, they are likely to to trust to a person, because they feel safer and understood. 

          </p>

          <p>Engaging a person as a human being, just like yourself and assuming the person is a good person, and deserves to be treated as such, helps to create to the conditions for trust.

          <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
          <p>Empathic listening is being able to listen for feelings. Our brains are built with this ability and it is something that we can improve with practice.  We can practise empathic listening with mindfulness, kindness and curiosity. I found it interesting how much I do this without being aware of it with loved ones, and become aware of this, made me curious when talking to other people i.e wondering what they might be feeling when they are telling me about their day.

          <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
          <p>I liked the loving kindness meditation and I also enjoyed the more traditional Metta Bhavana version. I like the simplicity of the phrases ‘May I be Well,  May I be happy, May I be free from suffering’, and the journey it takes you on.

          <p>If we move house I won’t be able to walk everywhere I need to go and will have to pay for public transport/drive. Location is important to me.

       <p>If we move house we house our rent will cheaper and we’ll have more space that we need. Having a more functional home is important to me.</p>
