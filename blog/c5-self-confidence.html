          <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
          <p>Self awareness is made up three emotional competencies, and the first being emotion awareness. This is recognising one’s emotions and their effects. The second one being accurate self-assessment: knowing one’s strengths and limits. The third is self confidence: This is a strong sense of one’s self-worth and capabilities. Self awareness and mindfulness are closely related and both are trainable. </p>

          <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
          
          <p>I decided to try the journalling self awareness practice because I have previously tried sometimes similar to the body scan practice. I used to keep journals when I was younger so I thought it would be an interesting experiment to try a journalling exercise as an adult.  
          </p>
          <p> like the expression ‘unfiltered brain dump’ used In the book, and I felt like it describes the exercise perfectly. My mind somewhat lighter and clearer after putting down my thoughts on paper about what is making me happy and what I am worried about. I was surprised at how such a short and simple exercise could help me put my thoughts/emotions into perspective.

          <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
          </h4>
          <p>That we are not are our emotions and that they should not define us. Mindfulness practice helps us shift our emotions from being existential (“I am”) to experiential (“I feel”). I really liked the traditional metaphor “Thoughts and emotions are like clouds—some beautiful, some dark—while our core being is like the sky. Clouds are not the sky; they are phenomena in the sky that come and go”. This is essentially saying 
            that thoughts and emotions are a phenomena in the mind and body that come and go, but they are not what we are, and what defines us.
