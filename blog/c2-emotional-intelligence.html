    <h1>C2 Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
    <p>motional intelligence is something that you can learn with practice; it is not an innate talent. Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer define is as “The ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions”.
    </p>

    <p>Emotional intelligence helps to create these useful skills: stellar work performance, outstanding leadership, and the ability to create the conditions for happiness.</p>

    <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?
    </h2>

    <p>Two minutes of mindfullness involves bringing awareness to our breathing and sitting without agenda for two minutes. I found this useful in the morning to start the day with clarity and useful in the evening to take a moment to unwind before bed.
