          <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
          <p> tired out the informal practice of mindful conversation using the components of listening (giving the art of attention to the speaker), looping (closer the the loop of communication by demonstrating that you have really heard what the person is saying) and dipping (checking in with yourself, knowing how you are feeling about what you are hearing). I found these practises helped to retain the memory of the conversation a lot longer, for example, I didn’t have to ask again a few hows later what the other person’s plans where for later on that day, as I could recall the conversation.easily.</p>

          <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
          <p>The first suggested technique to help sustain your practice is to have a buddy. This is because having a buddy can help you hold each other accountable and offer each other encouragement. The second technique is to ‘do less than you can’.This is stop mindfulness feeling like a chore or burden. If you do less formal practice the you are capable of it will make practice feel more enjoyable. The third technique is to ’take one breath a day’. The reason for this is that you can easily commit and fulfil to take one breath a day, and the practise encourages you to have an intention to do something kind and beneficial to yourself daily. The second and third techniques are something I am going to try to use to sustain my practice. </p>
