    <h1>2.2 Technical Blog Part 1</h1>

    <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>

        <p>I like the popular analogy that is used to explain HTML, CSS and DOM by thinking of them as a house. HTML would be the rooms of the house, the walls, the doors, the windows, the doors, etc. CSS would be the decorations, or the style, i.e. colour of paint of the wall, the colour or style of flooring, curtains, pictures on the wall etc. </p>

            
            
        <p> The DOM (Document Object Model is the structure or blue-print of the house. It can be thought of as a tree-like structure. Using the web developer tool in chrome you can see the branching by clicking on the triangles.</p> 
       
    <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>

        <p>Boxifying design is term used to turn everything on a webpage into boxes. Everything that you see on a webpage is made up of boxes (images, text, headings etc), and you can have multiple boxes inside other boxes. You can manipulate all of these individual boxes separately i.e size, colour etc. 
        </p>

    <h2>What is the box model?</h2>

    <p>We now know that everything we see on a webpage can be boxifyed. The box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of the content, padding, border, and margin. </p>
        
    <p>The content is in the middle of the box (image, text â€¦). This can be given a height/width.<br>
        The padding describes the space between this content and the border of the box.<br>
        The border is any kind of line (solid, dotted..) surrounding the content and padding.<br> 
        The margin is the space around the border.</p>
        
    <p>The total width/height of a box is the total of the content, padding, border and margin.</p>
