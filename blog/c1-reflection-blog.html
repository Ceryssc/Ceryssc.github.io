     <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
     <p>The environment is just as much as about your own personal growth and achievement, as it is about the people around you; its a creative community. A creative community growing and working together as a team.</p>

     <li>What are your impressions?</li>
     <p>It seems like a positive experience to be involved with. </p>

     <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
     <p>I think I will enjoy being in this type of atmosphere</p>

     <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
     <p>That you are encouraged to share and help others from day one in phase-0.</p>
     
     <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
     <p> Yes I am excited. I was nervous at first but feel calmer each day.</p>
