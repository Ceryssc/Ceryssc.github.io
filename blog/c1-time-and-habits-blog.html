    <h1>C1 Time and Habits</h1>
    
    <p>The idea of Growth Mindset and “Confidence is just displayed ability”, is an idea that spoke to me. I have never found the the concept of “you need to believe in yourself, then you’ll achieve it’ helpful. Starting with small steps that grow your confidence can help you improve and reach your goals. I have already started seeing myself do this with phase-0, I have already gained more confidence now I have a better understanding how the Terminal and command line work. </p>
    
    <p>The Pomodoro Technique is something I have been doing loosely over the years before I even knew It had a name. I find splitting my time into smaller chunks with little breaks lessens any anxiety with a task I may find intimidating at first. </p>
    
    <p>The article ‘Seven Counterintuitive Ways to Be Insanely Productive’ was an interesting read which I have bookedmarked to refer back to later. Instead of feeling restless and antsy that I have to keep sitting at a desk, I have been taking short walks when I need. I am lucky to live close to the ocean, and a quick visit to watch the waves and clear my head helps me to return to work with more focus.</p>
