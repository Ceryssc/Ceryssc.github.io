      bright pink.
    
      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

          <h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h4>
          <p>A responsive site is where a single website can adapt/change its layout etc to work well across a range of device screen sizes. It is important because we need websites to be be user friendly across all devices to have a better user experience, especially due to the ever increasing use of smartphones.

              <h4>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h4>
              <p>Mobile first design is designing how a website would like and how you would use it on a smartphone as your starting point and the gradually increasing the size to a tablet or laptop. It is important because the use of smartphones has changed the way we use the internet, where users prefer to use a smartphone to quickly access content rather than a bigger device.

                  <h4>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h4>
                  <p>A frame is defined as a package made up of of structure of files and folders of standardised code (HTML, CSS, JS etc..). Many websites have a similar structure, and frameworks provide is with a common structure so you don’t have to start from scratch.</p> 
                   <br>
                   <p>Pros: Speeds up the mock-up process, clean and tidy code, solutions to common CSS problems, Browser compatibility, helpful in collaborative work, security, low cost.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Cons: Slower learning curve because you don’t learn to do it yourself, used code leftover, forced to respect its limits, code is public so could be used against you. </p>

                      <h4>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h4>
                      <p>A wireframe is a two-dimensional blueprint that helps you design the hierarchy of the content and plan the layout of the website.</p>

                        <p>I decided to make my wireframes simple because I wanted to make sure I understood how to use the grid design well before I attempt anything more complex. I’m happy I decided to go with a simpler wireframe, because it took me a while to get confident with it. I changed my design a little as I went along, and I plan to play with it a bit more as its not quite finished, but need to move on!</p>
