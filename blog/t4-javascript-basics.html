          <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
          <p>HTML should be used for structured content, CCS should only be used for applying visual styles, and JavaScript is used for (almost) all interactive functionality. Javascript tells the browser how to change the web page in response to events that happen, like changing the value in a form input. </p>

          <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h4>
          <p>Control flow is about using conditional statements to perform different actions based on different conditions. Conditional statements are ‘if’ ‘else’ ‘else if’ and ‘switch’. An example can be shown using typical greetings: if the time is earlier than 10am, I will say “good morning. If the time is not earlier than 10am, but earlier than 6pm, I will say “good day”, otherwise I will say “good evening”.
          </p>
          <p>Loops continue to execute a set of code of over and over or until a certain condition is met. They are good if you want to run the same code over and over, each time with a different value. There are ‘for’ ‘while’ and ‘do…while’ loops.  An example is while children are from age  5 - 18, they continue to go to school. When they are 18, they stop. </p>

          <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
          <p>Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, like information for an album. Objects contain properties (format, release date) and the values of those properties, and are written as name:value pairs. You can access object properties by using objectName.propertyName or objectName[“propertyName”]. E.g. album.format or album[“format”].

              <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
              <p>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and is useful because it can be used many times with different arguments to produce different results. </p>
