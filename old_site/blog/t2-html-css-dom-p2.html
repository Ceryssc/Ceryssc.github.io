      <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>

         <P>Grid Based design is a system used by developers, based  on sequenced columns and rows, the helps align page elements. This column based-structure is used to place text, images, and functions in a way that is consistent throughout the design, organised and precise. The use of gird-based design also helps to create a consistent user experience across multiple devices. </P>
    
        <h2>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>

            <P>We need to create responsive web design to accommodate the different screen sizes of devices that exist across phones, tablets, desktops, TV’s, game consoles and wearables.  Responsive web design design responds to the needs of the user and the devices they’re using. This means the layout changes based on the size and capabilities of the device. </P>

        <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>

            <p>Semantic structure uses semantic elements. These are elements that describe its meaning or purpose of the information, such as ‘img’, ‘form’, ’h1’; they clearly define their content.  Using semantic structure makes HTML easier to read and maintain. Semantic structure also helps us to use titles’ hierarchy properly e.g. ‘h1’, ‘h2’, ‘h3’, ‘h4’.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>

            <p>I found grid-design interesting but I know there are other frameworks to have a look and explore. Eventually I would like to go back and learn more about Bootstrap once I feel confident using grid-design.</p>
