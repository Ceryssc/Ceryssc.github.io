          <h4>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h4>
          <p>One of the triggers I have when programming is being able to understand the code when it is presented to me, but then not being to apply it on my own to solutions with ease. This is what I understand to be a frustration at my own learning speed. I know that to develop deeper understanding more practise is needed, and Iâ€™ve been programming for a relatively short amount of time. It is unreasonable to expect complete understanding instantly, and not having to keep referring to my notes and online help. I know that with time and perseverance are the ways to solve this, but I can feel a disproportionate emotional response at times. </p>

          <h4>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h4>
          <p>I found the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond) interesting as I have been practising something similar to help deal with some of my anxious thoughts. I find it to a be a useful tool to help bring forward to perspective to a situation that I might otherwise find overwhelming. </p>
