          <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
          <p>I like the visualisation used in this meditation and found it helpful. I lied the idea of the metal habits the meditation can develop like seeing goodness in self and others and giving goodness to all.

              <h4>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
              <p> also liked the visualisation aspect of this meditation. I have learnt that I find visualisation to be a helpful tool. I found the previous mediation to have be more beneficial to myself, however I like how the Tonglen is about transformation, and I am willing to come back to it in the future.

                  <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?
                </h4>
                  <p>The SCARF model is made up of five domains: Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness. During my Phase 0 experience I have found there to be a status reward, when comparing myself to before the start of Phase 0.  I know more than when I started.  
                </p>
                <p>There has been less certainty at times, especially when I feel blocked, about how well I am progressing and will I have understood enough for bootcamp. 
                </p>
                <p>At bootcamp I think the SCARF model will apply more due to the cohort being together in person, and relatedness and fairness will take bigger roles. Bootcamp should hopefully bring more certainty and status also</p>

                  <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                  <p>I think the section about mindful e-mailing was useful and something to be aware of as e-mails are predominately how we communicate in a lot of situations.  Miscommunication is common and the five steps are worth taking when writing, especially involving delicate topics.</p>
