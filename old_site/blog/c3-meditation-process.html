          <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
          <p>The ‘process over product’ concept’ was something that I had to remind myself about during the redesign and rebuild of my site.  When I first tried to redesign my site I spent a lot of time worrying about how it would look and comparing it to other more advanced sites. I had to remember this concept and decided to go with a simple design so I could take the time fully learning how to build a 12x12 grid site and using the framework, instead of trying to add a lot of features and making it look super professional. </p>

              <h4> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
              <p>I thought that meditation was about sitting in a quiet place, in silence, in the traditional meditation pose with the aim to clear the mind, not thinking about anything.

                  <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
                  <p>That meditation I can be thought of as exercise for the mind. In exercise, when you train you get fitter, have more energy, your immune system improves, you feel good about yourself, can run further et. The same is true for mediation and your mind becomes calmer and clearer. Also the act of creating good intentions is itself a form of meditation. </p>

                <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
                <p>It was interesting that the traditional seven-point meditation posture is not really necessary in order to meditate. You just need to find a posture that works for you, that helps you remain alert and relaxed the same time for a long period of time. I also like the technique of thinking of your mind as a guard, watching you breath go in and out. </p>
