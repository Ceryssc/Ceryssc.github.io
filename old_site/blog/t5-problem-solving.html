          <h4>What was the problem?</h4>
          <p>I got stuck on the ‘Chapter 2 “Program Structure” of Eloquent Javascript” questions 2 & 3.</p>
          
          <h4>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h4>
          <p>The problem solving techniques I used were mostly googling and my own notes. I had to try out quite a bit of code before getting the solutions. </p>
         
          <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
          <p>Mostly frustrated and beginning to doubt my abilities.  I spent a lot of time on these and gave it many attempts that I lost count (mostly questions 3). 
            However when I decided to have a sneak peak at the answers I realised my code wasn’t too far off. It was also reassuring that I could understand how the solutions were found once I had seen the solution and did a bit of googling. </p>
          
          <h4> What did you learn?</h4>
          <p>To keep going and not to lose faith in myself because I can see how much I do understand already, and that I just need some more practise to solve these type of questions with ease.</p>

          <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Pseudocode</li>
              <li>Trying something</li>
              <li> Rubber ducky method</li>
              <li>Reading error messages</li>

              <li>Googling</li>
              <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
              <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
              <li> Improving your process with reflection</li>


          </ul>
          
          <p>I beginning to feel a lot more confident using the majority of these problem solving techniques and processes.
